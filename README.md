# TENOR: Efficient Document Labeling/Topic Modeling Tool to Exploratory Data Analysis

ðŸ”¥
TENOR is a user interface for speeding up document labeling process and reducing the number of documents needed to be labeled. See the paper for details:

## Getting Started

This tool's frontend code interface is adopted from [this repository](https://github.com/daniel-stephens/community_resilience). To run the app interface locally with the default Bills dataset, follow these steps:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pinafore/2023-document-annotation.git
cd 2023-document-annotation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data for topic model training. The processed data will be saved to the specified --new_json_path directory
```
./01_data_process.sh
```

#### 2. Training Topic Models

You can obtain trained topic models in two ways:

1. If you're looking to get started quickly without training your own models, we've got you covered. Pre-trained models on the bills dataset, configured with 35 topics, are ready for use. You can download these models directly from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-k6YcC2KLp8iULGF5zmpAYlpk49dbX4W?usp=sharing)


After downloading, place the model files in the following directory of your local repository:
```
./flask_app/Topic_Models/trained_Models/
```

2. Train Your Own Models

For those who need customized topic models, we provide a convenient script to facilitate the training process:

```bash
./02_train_model.sh
```

This script will lead you through the steps necessary to train new models, which will then be saved to the location specified in the bash script argument `--save_trained_model_path`.

**Configuration Note:**
The application defaults to using 35 topics for model training. If your requirements differ, please follow these steps to ensure compatibility:

1. Execute the model training script with the number of topics set to your preference.
2. Once training is complete, adjust the code in `app.py` to align with your model's topic count. Specifically, change the value on line 128 to correspond with the number of topics in your newly trained model.


#### 3. Starting the Web Application

To launch the web application on your local machine, execute the provided shell script by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./03_run_app.sh
```

Upon successful execution of the script, the web application will be available. You can access it by opening your web browser and navigating to:

```
http://localhost:5001
```

If you wish to use a different port than the default `5001`, ensure that the `03_run_app.sh` script is configured accordingly before starting the application.



## Dataset Information

This app supports two datasets:

1. **20newsgroup**: A collection of newsgroup documents.
2. **congressional_bill_project_dataset**: A compilation of Congressional Bill documents.

For the Congressional Bill dataset, the app uses data from these sources:

- [Comparative Agendas Project](https://www.comparativeagendas.net/us)
- [Congressional Bills](http://www.congressionalbills.org)

The original Bills dataset uses numbers as labels. To correlate topics with labels, consult the [Codebook](https://comparativeagendas.s3.amazonaws.com/codebookfiles/Codebook_PAP_2019.pdf).
