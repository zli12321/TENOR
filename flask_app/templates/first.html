    <div class="instructions">
      <p>We have a set of uncategorized US congressional bill documents in English, which cover a variety of subjects.
        Now we need to create labels for those documents to group them into different categories. Your task is to
        spend the next 60 minutes exploring the documents and creating category labels that make sense to you.</p>
      
    <p>Please note that this is not a summarization task, and we kindly request that you refrain from providing 
      summaries for the passages. Instead, focus on creating meaningful and general labels that can be applied to 
      multiple passages, ensuring that they are categorized effectively
    </p>

    <p>For this study you will be using an AI-assisted tool that helps humans label a collection of text passages with
      categories, or themes, of interest. You will be shown passages from the collection of congressional bills,
      alongside other potentially helpful information, such as cluster keywords generated by the AI-assisted tool
      from the content of the entire document collection to characterize the theme of
      the passage.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Label:</strong> A label for a passage can consist of a single word or a phrase</p>
    <p>Example labels: health, health insurance, child health plans…</p>

    <p><strong>Example instance for your task </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Topic keywords:</strong> secretary, wildlife, interior, resource, specie, conservation, management, fish ...(The Topic Keywords might not be given to you)</p> 
    <p><strong>Passage:</strong> “A bill to extend, pending internation agreement, the fisheries management responsibility and authority of the United States over the fish in certain areas in order to conserve and protect such fish from depletion."</p>
    <p><strong>Your created label:</strong> fisheries and fishing </p>

  
    <p>Throughout the study, the AI-assisted tool will also recommend documents to label, based on your past labeling
        decisions. Alternatively, you can choose any other document not recommended by the AI-assisted tool in the main
        Documents tab. The progress of work can be tracked in the 'view/edit response' section, where participants can
        modify their created or assigned labels as needed. Further instructions will be provided in a demo on the
        following screens.</p>

    
    <p>The total length of the task will not exceed one hour, and the majority of your time will be spent looking at
        passages and accompanying information in order to annotate passages with labels you create. Please note that for
        our purposes the quality of labels is just as important as efficiency: please take time to think of what you
        think are labels that do a good job of summarizing each passage.</p>
    
    <p>If you complete the hour-long session and followup survey following the instructions, you will be given a completion code and receive $20 as compensation.</p>
    <p>Any suspected fraud or abuse will result in forfeiture of compensation, and that includes not actually completing
        the task (Fewer than 80 documents unlabeled or low quality labels created). If you don't want to proceed, simply return your submission on prolific</p>
    
    <p>We will not ask you for any personally identifying information and the annotations will never require any
        de-anonymizing information from you whatsoever. You must be at least 18 years old in order to participate in
        this task. If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or if you need to report an injury related to the
        research, please contact the investigator:</p>
